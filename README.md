# Testing

  * i tested this website and i confirmed that i is responsive and looks good on all sizes and platforms.
  * i tested all the links and confirmed that they work and lead oto there designed pages .


  # bugs 
  #### index.html
  *  When i ran my index.html code in the W3C validator ,Section lacked heading,
  i was explained to my the W3C to consider using h2-h6 elements to add identifying headings to all sections, or else use a div element instead for any cases where no heading is needed.
  ---i add a div to he index.html

  *  i also discovered that using 'h1' headings is for top level heading only and i did not change because i considered the h1 at line 32 column 17 to line 32 column 20 as a top-level heading . 

#### aboutus.html and signup.html
i tested the aboutus.html and signup.html in the code validator which gave an error ; Style sheets should not include HTML syntax.

From line 1, column 1; to line 1, column 15 and  line 154, column 8
* There was a start tag error which i fixed by adding the <!DOCTYPE html>

* The form tag was closed yet there were open elements which i solved by losing the open tags
